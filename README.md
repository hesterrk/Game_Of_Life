# About the Game Of Life

-GOL is a program that simulates a 2D-cellular automaton. CA is represented by a grid of cells in this project.

-Each cell in the grid is defined as an entity which has its own state (alive or dead, black or white)

-Each cell has a neighbourhood (8 cells surrounding it) —> this is important as a cell’s change in state is determined by the rules based on the cell's neighbourhood state.

-Read more about the rules on the project's page!
